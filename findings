Using the Bank Churn dataset, I conducted a series of SQL analyses in pgAdmin to explore patterns and drivers of customer activity. Through queries involving aggregation, conditional logic, and window functions, I identified key behavioral and demographic factors influencing churn.

The analysis revealed that:
France had the highest churn rate compared to other regions.
Middle-aged customers (ages 40â€“49) showed the greatest likelihood of leaving the bank.
Customers with only one product were significantly more likely to churn, suggesting lower engagement.
Inactive members and those with lower credit scores were also more prone to exit.
Customers with higher balances tended to remain, while those with lower balances showed greater volatility.

Overall, the SQL analysis demonstrated how customer segmentation, behavioral metrics, and product engagement can be leveraged to identify at-risk customers and support data-driven retention strategies.
