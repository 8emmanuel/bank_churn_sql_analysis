This project uses the Bank Churn dataset to demonstrate SQL and data analysis skills. The dataset contains customer demographic and financial information, including credit scores, account balances, tenure, number of products, and whether a customer exited (churned) from the bank.

The goal of this project is to design, query, and analyze a structured database that answers key business questions around customer retention, churn behavior, and product engagement.

Through this project, I focused on exploring what factors influence customer churn, such as age, geography, activity status, and account features.
